# 'Hello, world!' in Chapel

This repository contains starter code for a Chapel project. There are two ways to get started with writing Chapel:

## Using a Codespace

The `chapel-hello-world` repo includes a `devcontainer.json` file, making it usable from GitHub Codespaces. Simply click __Use this template > Open in a codespace__ to get started. The codespace includes the Visual Studio Code extension for Chapel, and tools such as [`chpl-language-server`](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/main/tools/chpl-language-server/chpl-language-server.html) and [`chplcheck`](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/main/tools/chplcheck/chplcheck.html).

## Using Your Machine

Please follow the instructions on the [Download Chapel](https://chapel-lang.org/download.html) page to get set up with the Chapel compiler `chpl`. From there, you can compile and run the `hello.chpl` file in this repository as follows:

```bash
chpl hello.chpl
./hello
```
